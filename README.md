# Inter-VLAN Using Multilayer Switch

This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer lab** demonstrating **Inter-VLAN communication** using a **Multilayer Switch (MLS)**.  
It showcases how to configure **Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs)** and enable routing directly on the switch for faster and more efficient VLAN communication.
